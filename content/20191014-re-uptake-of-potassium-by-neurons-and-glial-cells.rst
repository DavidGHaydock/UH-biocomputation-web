This week on Jurnal Club session Reinoud Maex will present the paper `"Computer simulations of neuron-glia interactions mediated by ion flux"

------------

This paper resolves two questions that have bothered me since long:

- How can (neuronal or glial) potassium channels contribute to the re-uptake of potassium, hence how can the outward flow of potassium become an inward flow?
- Why is the sodium-potassium pump electrogenic, hence why are three sodium ions exchanged for only two potassium ions?
