:summary: Edward Wakelam's session on sloping the interview and career development playing fields in one's favour.

Organisations have to ensure that they recruit the best candidates at every level and develop their staff in paths closely aligned with their corporate styles, missions and objectives.  This not only ensures a positive and integrated work force and organisation, it also allows protection against maverick interviewers and managers promoting or overlooking staff randomly (or worse). To achieve this, most professional organisations have clearly defined processes which guide and regulate interviewers and which formalise staff development.  Understanding these formal processes and methods will give candidates and staff a substantial advantage over those who don't.  My talk will give attendees a comprehensive view of real examples of interview questions and crucially the real assessment criteria that the interviewer is looking to document evidence of suitability against.  In respect of career development my talk will give you a comprehensive example of how career paths in a professional services organisation are defined and the success criteria for progression.  In both cases I will give you the insider's view and my own rules and  tips for success, accumulated over many years in blue chip international corporations.
