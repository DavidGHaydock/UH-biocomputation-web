:summary: Anuradha's talk on the Human Speech Spectrum, Frequency Range and Formants. 

This talk is based on the article " Human Speech Spectrum, Frequency Range, Formants" by Bernd Noack; Research Director CNRS (Centre Nationnal de la Recherche Scientifique), LIMSI-CNRS, France.
 
In this talk Anuradha will summarise the article and attempt to explain some fundamental features of human speech.
In particular, She will show the range of frequencies typically used by men and women.
She will also explain the role of formants (concentration of energy at particular frequency) in speech communication.
 
Vowels play an important part in the formation of words and how they are vocalised.
In fact, as will be shown much of the energy in human speech is used in the production of vowels.
 
Anuradha will also demonstrate how the human voice can be heard against the background of a full orchestra, even though the total sound from the orchestra is much louder than the singer (typically a soprano).
 
Finally, she will show the relationship between distance and received speech level.
