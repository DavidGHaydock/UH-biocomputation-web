------

Computational models of neurons vary in their biological realism and level of detail, ranging from point neurons such as simple and adaptive exponential integrate-and-fire and Izhikevich models to morphologically realistic conductance based multi-compartmental models. Multi-compartmental models often include representations of voltage and ligand gated ion channels; these can be modelled using (commonly) the Hodgkin-Huxley or (sometimes) the Markov formalism. In this talk, I will give a basic introduction to compartmental modelling of neurons and discuss the Hodgkin-Huxley model. The Hodgkin-Huxley model is one of the foundations of computational neuroscience, having been published in a series of seminal articles in 1952 and leading to the award of the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine to Alan Hodgkin and Andrew Huxley in 1963.
