This week on Journal Club session Muhammad Yaqoob will talk about the paper "Towards Explainable Artificial Intelligence".

------------

In recent years, machine learning (ML) has become a key enabling 
technology for the sciences and industry. Especially through 
improvements in methodology, the availability of large databases 
and increased computational power, today's ML algorithms are able 
to achieve excellent performance (at times even exceeding the 
human level) on an increasing number of complex tasks. Deep 
learning models are at the forefront of this development. However, 
due to their nested non-linear structure, these powerful models 
have been generally considered "black boxes",  not providing 
any information about what exactly makes them arrive at their 
predictions. Since in many applications, e.g., in the medical 
domain, such lack of transparency may be not acceptable, the 
development of methods for visualizing, explaining and 
interpreting deep learning models has recently attracted 
increasing attention. This introductory paper presents recent 
developments and applications in this field and makes a plea 
for a wider use of explainable learning algorithms in practice.
