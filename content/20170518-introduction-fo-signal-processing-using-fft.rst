:summary: Anuradha Sulane's journal club session on FFT.

A Fourier Transform takes a signal (usually acoustic or any sequence of data) and finds the frequencies that are dominant in the signal.  For example: A pure middle 'C' note from piano.

Why is it important?

a) Source separation
b) Identifying emotions in voices.

So it's important for me as I am researching in emotion detection from speech. 

FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) is a very efficient algorithm for computing the power spectrum (Fourier transform). The normal Fourier Transform is a O(N^2), whereas FFT is O( N log(N)).

So in this workshop I will show how FFT can be performed in real-time and I will show how human voices produce different power spectrum.  I will also let the audience see what their own vocal profile looks like.
