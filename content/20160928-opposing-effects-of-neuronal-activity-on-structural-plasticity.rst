:summary: Ankur Sinha's journal club session on the opposing effects of neuronal activity on structural plasticity

The connectivity of the brain is continuously adjusted to new environmental
influences by several activity-dependent adaptive processes. The most
investigated adaptive mechanism is activity-dependent functional or synaptic
plasticity regulating the transmission efficacy of existing synapses. Another
important but less prominently discussed adaptive process is structural
plasticity, which changes the connectivity by the formation and deletion of
synapses. In this review, we show, based on experimental evidence, that
structural plasticity can be classified similar to synaptic plasticity into two
categories: (i) Hebbian structural plasticity, which leads to an increase
(decrease) of the number of synapses during phases of high (low) neuronal
activity and (ii) homeostatic structural plasticity, which balances these
changes by removing and adding synapses.  Furthermore, based on experimental
and theoretical insights, we argue that each type of structural plasticity
fulfills a different function. While Hebbian structural changes enhance memory
lifetime, storage capacity, and memory robustness, homeostatic structural
plasticity self-organizes the connectivity of the neural network to assure
stability. However, the link between functional synaptic and structural
plasticity as well as the detailed interactions between Hebbian and homeostatic
structural plasticity are more complex. This implies even richer dynamics
requiring further experimental and theoretical investigations.
