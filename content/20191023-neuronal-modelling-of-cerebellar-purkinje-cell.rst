This week on Journal Club session Ohki Katakura's will talk about neuronal modelling of cerebellar Purkinje cell while referencing various papers.

------------

Cerebellar Purkinje cell is the hugest and the most complicated neuron 
in the cerebellum. As well as cerebellar cortex network, some 
researchers think that the cell has rich computational capacity because 
of its complexity. Based on experimental studies, it was realistically 
modelled in 1994 (De Schutter & Bower, 1994ab), and then the model has 
been recently updated (Masoli et al., 2015; Zang et al., 2018). In this 
session, I will introduce details of the models (i.e., morphology and 
embedded ion channels) and the differences between all three of them.
