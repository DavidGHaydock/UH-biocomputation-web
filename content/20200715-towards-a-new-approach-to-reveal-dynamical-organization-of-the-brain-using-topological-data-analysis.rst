This week on Journal Club session Emil Dmitruk will talk about the paper "Towards a new approach to reveal dynamical organization of the brain using topological data analysis".

------------

Little is known about how our brains dynamically adapt for efficient functioning. Most 
previous work has focused on analyzing changes in co-fluctuations between a set of 
brain regions over several temporal segments of the data. We argue that by 
collapsing data in space or time, we stand to lose useful information about the brain’s 
dynamical organization. Here we use Topological Data Analysis to reveal the overall 
organization of whole-brain activity maps at a single-participant level—as an 
interactive representation—without arbitrarily collapsing data in space or time. Using 
existing multitask fMRI datasets, with the known ground truth about the timing of 
transitions from one task-block to next, our approach tracks both within- and 
between-task transitions at a much faster time scale (~4–9 s) than before. The 
individual differences in the revealed dynamical organization predict task 
performance. In summary, our approach distills complex brain dynamics into 
interactive and behaviorally relevant representations.
