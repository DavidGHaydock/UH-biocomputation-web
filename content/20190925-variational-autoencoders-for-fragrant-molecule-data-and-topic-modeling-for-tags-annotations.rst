Vinesh Bhunjun's journal club session, where will he present the effects of his cooperation with our laboratory.


------------

In this talk, I will explore two separate themes:
1) a summary of the work I have done over the past 4 weeks on Variational AutoEncoders (VAE) as applied to fragrant molecule data. VAEs provide a compact latent representation of the input from which it is possible to reconstruct the input.
2) a summary of some topic modeling projects I have been involved in for my day job as a software engineer working with tags/annotations..
