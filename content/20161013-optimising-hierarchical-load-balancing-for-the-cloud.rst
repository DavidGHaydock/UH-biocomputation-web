:summary: Paul Moggridge introduces his research on optimising hierarchical load balancing for the cloud in this week's journal club session.

In the first half of the presentation we will cover the evolution and characteristics of the cloud computing. We will look in particular at the different existing algorithms for load balancing in the cloud. In second half we will see where my research topic fits in along with the challenges and significance of my research.
