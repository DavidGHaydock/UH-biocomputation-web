:summary: Neil Davey's journal club session on Network Connectivity.

I will discuss how a network (for example a neural network) can be
characterized using Graph Theory.  In particular I will discuss random
networks, lattices and the interesting in between connectivity of a
small world network.  We will also play the Kevin Bacon game.  Finally
I will discuss our own research on network connectivity effects
performance and what this might be for cortical connectivity.
