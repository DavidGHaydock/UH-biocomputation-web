:summary: Ankur Sinha's journal club session on Git.

If you're part of the group, I assume your research requires you to
programme quite a bit. Even more, I assume your research requires you
to make changes to your code on a daily basis.

So, how do you go about this?

- Do you keep different folders for each change? 

- How do you backup your code - do you put everything on Dropbox each night? (If you back up at all!?)

- How do you find exactly what changes you made - do you read through your files and try to find them manually?

- How do you share your code with other people (your supervisors, your collaborators?)? Do you send zip files over e-mail?

These are common issues that each coder runs into at some point, and
luckily, there are tools that make all these tasks very very easy and
really really quick. 

Github_ and Bitbucket_ have really changed the software development
process recently. Many projects, such as the `Open Source Brain project`_
already use Github. The underlying tool that they use is called Git_.
It's simple enough for small projects to use and also efficient enough
to manage the more than 15 million lines of code that make the `Linux
Kernel`_ - written by **thousands** of different people.

In this talk, I'm going to try to convince you that if you write any
code, irrespective of what language it is in and how much it is, you
must use source code management - preferably Git. To do this, I'm going
to show you how to use easily Git on a daily basis, show you how to
collaborate using Git, and then show off some advanced features of Git
that you may need once in a while.

If you'd like to follow the talk better and use the commands as I show 
them, please consider bringing a laptop with `Git installed`_ on it. On
Linux - Ubuntu variants and Fedora etc., you should be able to install
it using your package manager. On Windows, you'll need to install it
from here: https://git-scm.com/download/win On Mac, you'll need to get
it from here: http://git-scm.com/download/mac
