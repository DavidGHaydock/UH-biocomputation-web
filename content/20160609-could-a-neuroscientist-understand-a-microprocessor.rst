:summary: Christoph Metzner's journal club session where he discusses the paper, `'Could a neuroscientist understand a microprocessor?' <http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/05/26/055624.abstract>`__

There is a popular belief in neuroscience that we are primarily data
limited, that producing large, multimodal, and complex datasets will,
enabled by data analysis algorithms, lead to fundamental insights into
the way the brain processes information. Microprocessors are among
those artificial information processing systems that are both complex
and that we understand at all levels, from the overall logical flow,
via logical gates, to the dynamics of transistors. Here we take a
simulated classical microprocessor as a model organism, and use our
ability to perform arbitrary experiments on it to see if popular data
analysis methods from neuroscience can elucidate the way it processes
information. We show that the approaches reveal interesting structure
in the data but do not meaningfully describe the hierarchy of
information processing in the processor. This suggests that current
approaches in neuroscience may fall short of producing meaningful
models of the brain.
