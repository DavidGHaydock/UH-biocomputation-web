Applications are invited for a Lecturer or Senior Lecturer in the School of Computer Science, University of Hertfordshire. The successful candidate will be expected to contribute to the School's teaching and curriculum development activities, and to strengthen its research activities. We are looking to recruit specifically a computer scientist with background in machine learning or data science related to biocomputation (including computational neuroscience). By Data Science we broadly mean the extraction of meaning from large quantities of data. The successful candidate will also have the flexibility to teach across mainstream topics in computer science. The School has an international reputation for teaching and research, with 58 academic staff, 20 adjunct lecturer staff, and 65 research students and postdoctoral research staff. With a history going back to 1958, the School teaches one of the largest cohorts of undergraduate students in the UK, and also delivers a thriving online computer science degree programme.

The person appointed will be expected to contribute to learning and teaching relevant to core computer science topics, participate in curriculum review and development, design and develop new modules, and supervise student projects at all levels. The appointee will strengthen the research culture in the School by pursuing research as part of a larger research team, seeking external funding, publishing papers, supervising research students, and participating in commercial activity as appropriate. Preference will be given to candidates who can contribute to teaching and research in databases as outlined above.

Applicants must hold a PhD (or equivalent) in a relevant subject, possess excellent communication skills in English and the ability to teach at undergraduate and postgraduate level. It is desirable that candidates have a track record of publication, external research funding, collaboration across disciplines, experience of different types of assessment and higher education quality assurance. They should also have the ability to play a role in the routine running of the School of Computer Science.

Applications should be made through http://www.herts.ac.uk/contact-us/jobs-and-vacancies/academic-vacancies (reference 014050). Informal enquiries may be addressed to Dr Volker Steuber (Head of the Biocomputation Research Group, v.steuber at herts.ac.uk) or Professor William Clocksin (Dean of School, w.clocksin at herts.ac.uk). Please note that applications sent directly to these email addresses will not be accepted. 

We are committed to providing a supportive environment. The university also provides an onsite childcare facility and child-centred holiday clubs. The University is required to meet UKVI visa regulations. Applicants who do not currently have the right to work in the UK will have to satisfy UKVI regulations before they can be appointed.
