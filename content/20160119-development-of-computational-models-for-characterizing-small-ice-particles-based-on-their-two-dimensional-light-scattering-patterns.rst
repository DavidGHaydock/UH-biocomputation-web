:summary: Yi Sun's journal club session on the development of computational models for characterizing small ice particles based on their two-dimensional light scattering patterns.

Clouds and their constituents (mostly small particles) have relationships with climate change. Better understanding and characterization of cloud particles is essential for the creation of better climate models for better understanding of climate and its dynamics/changes.

Widely used cloud particle imager has resolution limitations. Two-dimensional light scattering patterns (2DLS patterns) of particles is an increasingly more promising approach for characterising cloud particles.

Existing methods for characterizing cloud particles based on their 2DLS patterns perform poorly especially for patterns with too little speckles or with numerous fringes.

In this talk, I will focus on the background of the project, and one MSc project on this topic which has been done in UH. Especially, I will show the experimental results obtained using features insensitive to image rotation.
