`The pricing of options and corporate liabilities (1973)`_

If options are correctly priced in the market, it should not be
possible to make sure profits by creating portfolios of long and short
positions in options and their underlying stocks. Using this
principle, a theoretical valuation formula for options is derived.
Since almost all corporate liabilities can be viewed as combinations
of options, the formula and the analysis that led to it are also
applicable to corporate liabilities such as common stock, corporate
bonds, and warrants. In particular, the formula can be used to derive
the discount that should be applied to a corporate bond because of the
possibility of default.
