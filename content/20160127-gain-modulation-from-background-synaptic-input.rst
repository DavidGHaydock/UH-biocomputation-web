:summary: Maria Psarrou's journal club session where she discusses the paper, `'Gain modulation from background synaptic input' (Chance et al. (2002)) <http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627302008206>`__ .

Gain modulation is a prominent feature of neuronal activity recorded in
behaving animals, but the mechanism by which it occurs is unknown. By
introducing a barrage of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic conductances that
mimics conditions encountered in vivo into pyramidal neurons in slices of rat
somatosensory cortex, we show that the gain of a neuronal response to
excitatory drive can be modulated by varying the level of “background” synaptic
input. Simultaneously increasing both excitatory and inhibitory background
firing rates in a balanced manner results in a divisive gain modulation of the
neuronal response without appreciable signal-independent increases in firing
rate or spike-train variability. These results suggest that, within active
cortical circuits, the overall level of synaptic input to a neuron acts as a
gain control signal that modulates responsiveness to excitatory drive.
