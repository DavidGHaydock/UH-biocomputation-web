The fitness landscape of MAX-3-SAT is investigated for random instances above
the satisfiability phase transition. This paper includes a scaling analysis of
the time to reach a local optimum, the number of local optima, the expected
probability of reaching a local optimum as a function of its fitness, the
expected fitness found by local search and the best fitness, the probability of
reaching a global optimum, the size and relative positions of the global
optima, the mean distance between the local and global optima, the expected
fitness as a function of the Hamming distance from an optimum and their basins
of attraction. These analyses show why the problem becomes hard for local
search algorithms as the system size increases. The paper also shows how a
recently proposed algorithm can exploit long-range correlations in the fitness
landscape to improve on the state-of-the-art heuristic algorithms.
