:summary: Andrei's journal club session on SymPy_.

SymPy_ is an open source computer algebra system (CAS) implemented as a Python
library. Besides providing the usual CAS features such as solving equations and
performing symbolic integration and differentiations, it has the added benefit
that it can be used seamlessly as a part of regular Python programs. I will
show how the features of SymPy_ help our research.
