------

Identification of causal mutations in barley and wheat is hampered by their
large genomes and suppressed recombination. To overcome these obstacles, we
have developed MutChromSeq, a complexity reduction approach based on flow
sorting and sequencing of mutant chromosomes, to identify induced mutations by
comparison to parental chromosomes. We apply MutChromSeq to six mutants each of
the barley Eceriferum-q gene and the wheat Pm2 genes. This approach
unambiguously identified single candidate genes that were verified by Sanger
sequencing of additional mutants. MutChromSeq enables reference-free forward
genetics in barley and wheat, thus opening up their pan-genomes to functional
genomics.
