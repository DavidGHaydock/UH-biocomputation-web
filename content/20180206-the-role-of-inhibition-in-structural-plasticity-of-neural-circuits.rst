:summary: Ankur Sinha's journal club session on the role of inhibition in
          structural plasticity of neural circuits.


Activity dependent structural plasticity continuously reshapes cortical
circuits. While the reconfiguration of excitatory circuits is known to produce
functional changes, studies have recently shown that this is accompanied by the
simultaneous remodelling of inhibitory circuits also. Further, recent evidence
suggests that inhibition plays a critical role in the structural
reorganization of neural circuits.

In this session, I shall provide an overview of the observations documented in
the literature, discuss proposed mechanisms underlying structural plasticity,
and summarise questions that require further study.
