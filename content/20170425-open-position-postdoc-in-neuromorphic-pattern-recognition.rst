:summary: Applications are invited for a postdoc position in the Biocomputation group, at the University of Hertfordshire, UK. The appointment is due to start as soon as possible. Please apply online via http://jobs.herts.ac.uk, vacancy reference 014592, until 22nd May, 2017 at the latest. More details within.

Applications are invited for a postdoc position in the Biocomputation group at the `University of Hertfordshire <http://www.herts.ac.uk/>`__, UK. The appointment is due to start as soon as possible, with an initial fixed duration until 31st March 2018, with a possibility to extend, pending funding decisions.

The successful candidate will join our efforts to advance neuromorphic pattern recognition on the SpiNNaker_ and BrainScaleS_ hardware systems that are built within the `Human Brain Project (HBP)`_. We are looking for a candidate with a keen tenacity in pushing forward the boundaries of future computing off the well-trodden path.

The Biocomputation group provides a rich and inspiring interdisciplinary research environment that connects Computer Science with Neuroscience and branches out into Machine Learning and Robotics.

HBP membership provides excellent opportunities to connect to world-leading scientists in all aspects of neuroscience, high-performance computing, neurorobotics and neuromorphic engineering. We enjoy first-class access to the latest neuromorphic technologies developed in HBP, and we work in tight interaction with the groups developing the hardware systems, SpiNNaker_ and BrainScaleS_.

Research in Computer Science at the University of Hertfordshire has been recognized as excellent in the REF 2014, with 50% of the research submitted rated as internationally excellent or world leading. The University is situated in Hatfield, in the green belt just north of London.

Candidates should have a PhD in neuromorphic computing, machine learning, computational neuroscience, computer science, physics or another relevant subject area. In addition, the successful candidate should have demonstrable experience in either:

- Machine learning and pattern recognition, ideally deep and recurrent neural networks, self-organisation, or
- Neuromorphic computing, ideally with hands-on experience with SpiNNaker_, BrainScaleS_, or other neuromorphic hardware systems, or GPU-accelerated simulations.

Further desired skills:

- Ability to conduct original research, as evidenced by high-quality, peer-reviewed papers,
- Excellent programming skills, as evidenced e.g. by a link to a github account that shows work on relevant projects,
- Ability to work and communicate in a multidisciplinary team.
