:summary: Jean Petrić's journal club session where he speaks about his work on software defect prediction.

Software defects are anomalies in software code that cause a
working product to behave in an unintended way. Some of these
defects can have fatal consequences for people, cost companies
millions of pounds, and even damage their reputation.

Software defect prediction aims to build prediction models that
can point out places in software code that are likely to contain
defects. Although a lot of work has been done, defect prediction
models are still not powerful enough to be supported by software
companies. Common problems are high rates of false positives,
and models that work only for specific software products.

To begin with, I will describe the history of predicting defects in
software, I will then move to common practices in software
defect prediction. Finally, I will conclude with a summary of my
work that focuses on building advanced prediction models.
