:summary: Weam Binjuman's journal club session on error correction over optical transmission.

Reducing bit error rate and improving performance of modern coherent optical communication system is a significant issue. As the distance travelled by the information signal increases, bit error rate will degrade. Support Vector Machines are the most up to date machine learning method for error correction in optical transmission systems. Wavelet transform has been a popular method to signals processing. In this study, the properties of most used Haar and Daubechies wavelets are implemented for signals correction. Our results show that the bit error rate can be improved by using classification based on wavelet transforms (WT) and support vector machine (SVM).
