Cortical neurons receive balanced excitatory and inhibitory synaptic
currents. Such a balance could be established and maintained in an
experience-dependent manner by synaptic plasticity at inhibitory
synapses. We show that this mechanism provides an explanation for the
sparse firing patterns observed in response to natural stimuli and fits
well with a recently observed interaction of excitatory and inhibitory
receptive field plasticity. The introduction of inhibitory plasticity
in suitable recurrent networks provides a homeostatic mechanism that le
ads to asynchronous irregular network states. Further, it can
accommodate synaptic memories with activity patterns that become
indiscernible from the background state but can be reactivated by
external stimuli. Our results suggest an essential role of inhibitory
plasticity in the formation and maintenance of functional cortical
circuitry.

Volker said he'd also discuss the paper by Woodin, Ganguly and Poo
(2003) that forms the experimental basis of the learning rule in the
above paper.
