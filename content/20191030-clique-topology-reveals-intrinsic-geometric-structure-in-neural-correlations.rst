Detecting meaningful structure in neural activity and connectivity data is 
challenging in the presence of hidden nonlinearities, where traditional 
eigenvalue-based methods may be misleading. We introduce a novel approach 
to matrix analysis, called clique topology, that extracts features of the 
data invariant under nonlinear monotone transformations. These features 
can be used to detect both random and geometric structure, and depend only 
on the relative ordering of matrix entries. We then analyzed the activity 
of pyramidal neurons in rat hippocampus, recorded while the animal was 
exploring a two-dimensional environment, and confirmed that our method 
is able to detect geometric organization using only the intrinsic pattern 
of neural correlations. Remarkably, we found similar results during 
non-spatial behaviors such as wheel running and REM sleep. This suggests 
that the geometric structure of correlations is shaped by the underlying 
hippocampal circuits, and is not merely a consequence of position coding. 
We propose that clique topology is a powerful new tool for matrix analysis 
in biological settings, where the relationship of observed quantities to 
more meaningful variables is often nonlinear and unknown.
