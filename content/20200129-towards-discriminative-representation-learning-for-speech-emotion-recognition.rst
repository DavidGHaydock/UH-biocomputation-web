This week on Journal Club session Yi Sun will talk about the paper "Towards Discriminative representation learning for speech Emotion recognition".


------------

In intelligent speech interaction, automatic speech emotion recognition (SER) 
plays an important role in understanding user intention. While sentimental 
speech has different speaker characteristics but similar acoustic attributes, 
one vital challenge in SER is how to learn robust and discriminative 
representations for emotion inferring. In this paper, inspired by human 
emotion perception, we propose a novel representation learning component (RLC) 
for SER system, which is constructed with Multi-head Self-attention and Global 
Context-aware Attention Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neutral Network 
(GCA-LSTM). With the ability of Multi-head Self-attention mechanism in 
modeling the element-wise correlative dependencies, RLC can exploit the 
common patterns of sentimental speech features to enhance emotion-salient 
information importing in representation learning. By employing GCA-LSTM, 
RLC can selectively focus on emotion-salient factors with the consideration 
of entire utterance context, and gradually produce discriminative representation 
for emotion inferring. Experiments on public emotional benchmark database 
IEMOCAP and a tremendous realistic interaction database demonstrate the 
outperformance of the proposed SER framework, with 6.6% to 26.7% relative 
improvement on unweighted accuracy compared to state-of-the-art techniques.
