:summary: Michael Schmuker's journal club session on Opportunities and challenges in the Human Brain Project.

The Human Brain Project (HBP) is a 10-year "flagship research initiative" funded
by the EU. Last September, the University of Hertfordshire has joined this
initiative as one of over 120 international partners. The goal of HBP is to
"accelerate the fields of neuroscience, computing and brain-related medicine"
[1].

In my presentation I will give an overview on the science that is done in HBP,
with a special focus on our specific role within this huge project.  The HBP
provides 6 "research platforms" that are potentially highly relevant to ongoing
projects in the Biocomputation group. I will introduce two of those platforms in
more detail, i.e. the neuromorphic computing platform and the neurorobotics
platform.
