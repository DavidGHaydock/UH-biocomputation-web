:summary: Volker Steuber's journal club session on resources for neuronal modelling

Neuronal simulation software packages such as GENESIS and NEURON have been available for more than 25 years. However, the last 5 years have seen a rapid growth of a variety of openly available resources for neuronal modelling, with a particular focus on open access to software, models and simulation and experimental data. I will give an overview of resources that are currently available and present a selection of simulators for neuronal modelling at different levels of detail, computational and experimental databases, tools for the generation and analysis of neuronal morphologies and interoperability frameworks.
