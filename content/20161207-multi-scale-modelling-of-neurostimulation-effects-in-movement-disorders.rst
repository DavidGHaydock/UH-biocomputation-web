:summary: Nada Yousif's journal club session on the multi scale modelling of neurostimulation effects in movement disorders.

Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a clinical therapy, involving the surgical
implantation of electrodes into disorder specific nuclei, used to treat
the symptoms of movement disorders such as ParkinsonÂ¹s disease and
essential tremor (ET). The mechanisms through which the electrical
stimulation leads to the observed clinical improvements remain unclear, to
the extent that it is unknown how stimulation changes neuronal excitation.
If we better understood these mechanisms, we could optimise the parameters
setting process and minimise unwanted side effects. To study the effect of
stimulation on the firing activity of axons, single neurons, and networks
of neurons, I take a multi-level computational modelling approach. First I
create a finite element model to calculate the distribution of electric
potential induced by DBS and then applied the potential as an
extracellular stimulus to multicompartment axon or neuron models. I have
previously shown that such models can reveal detailed spatial effects of
stimulation in the vicinity of the electrode. To study network level
changes, I model the network proposed to be involved in generating
pathological synchronous activity via a Wilson-Cowan approach. The
parameter space of such a model can be explored to uncover regions which
produced oscillatory thalamic activity in the typical ET frequency range
(4-12Hz). Taken together, these models demonstrate a method of
quantitatively assessing neuronal changes induced by DBS, to maximise
therapeutic benefit and minimise unwanted side effects.
