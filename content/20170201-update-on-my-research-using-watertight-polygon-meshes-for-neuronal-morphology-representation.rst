:summary: Marco Craveiro's journal club session on watertight polygon meshes.

This presentation is an update on my earlier talk on the same subject and is
related to my current research: using polygon meshes as a way to represent
neuronal morphologies. I will revisit the previous presentation as a way to
provide the required background, touching briefly on the acquisition of
neuronal morphology data from microscopy and the generation of computer
representations using the SWC format.  The second part of the presentation will
focus on the advantages of 3D meshes and the internal code structure of the
processing pipeline in my project. Finally, I will discuss how I intend to
tease out a research question out of what is largely a software engineering
problem.

As previously, basic understanding of the paper by McDougal et al. [1] is
useful.
