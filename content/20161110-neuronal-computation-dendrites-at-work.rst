:summary: Benjamin Torben-Nielsen's journal club session on dendritic computation.

Brain dynamics emerge from the collective and orchestrated activity of single neurons. The main characteristics of neurons are their morphologically elaborate structures to receive and integrate inputs (i.e., the dendrites) and communicate their signal to other neurons (i.e., the axons). Because dendrites receive, integrate and transform inputs into relevant output they can be considered as the functional workhorses of the brain.

In this presentation, I’ll outline the problematic relation between dendrite structure and function in neurons. Then I’ll show how highly non-trivial processing can take place in neurons due to the spatial extend of dendrites. Lastly, I will present my current work on distilling the essence of dendritic computations using simplified models.
