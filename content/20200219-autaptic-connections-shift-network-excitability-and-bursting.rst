This week on Journal Club session Yaqoob Muhammad will talk about the paper "Autaptic Connections Shift Network Excitability and Bursting".


------------

We examine the role of structural autapses, when a neuron synapses onto itself, in driving network-
wide bursting behavior. Using a simple spiking model of neuronal activity, we study how autaptic
connections affect activity patterns, and evaluate if controllability significantly affects changes in
bursting from autaptic connections. Adding more autaptic connections to excitatory neurons increased
the number of spiking events and the number of network-wide bursts. We observed excitatory synapses
contributed more to bursting behavior than inhibitory synapses. We evaluated if neurons with high
average controllability, predicted to push the network into easily achievable states, affected bursting
behavior differently than neurons with high modal controllability, thought to influence the network
into difficult to reach states. Results show autaptic connections to excitatory neurons with high average
controllability led to higher burst frequencies than adding the same number of self-looping connections
to neurons with high modal controllability. The number of autapses required to induce bursting was
lowered by adding autapses to high degree excitatory neurons. These results suggest a role of autaptic
connections in controlling network-wide bursts in diverse cortical and subcortical regions of mammalian
brain. Moreover, they open up new avenues for the study of dynamic neurophysiological correlates of
structural controllability.
