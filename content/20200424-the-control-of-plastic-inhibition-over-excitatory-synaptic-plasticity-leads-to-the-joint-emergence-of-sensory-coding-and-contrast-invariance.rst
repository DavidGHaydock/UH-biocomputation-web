Visual stimuli are represented by a highly efficient code in the primary visual cortex,
but the development of this code is still unclear. Two distinct factors control coding 
efficiency: Representational efficiency, which is determined by neuronal tuning diversity,
and metabolic efficiency, which is influenced by neuronal gain. How these determinants of
coding efficiency are shaped during development, supported by excitatory and inhibitory 
plasticity, is only partially understood. We investigate a fully plastic spiking network 
of the primary visual cortex, building on phenomenological plasticity rules. Our results 
show that inhibitory plasticity is key to the emergence of tuning diversity and accurate 
input encoding. Additionally, inhibitory feedback increases the metabolic efficiency by 
implementing a gain control mechanism. Interestingly, this led to the spontaneous 
emergence of contrast-invariant tuning curves. Our findings highlight the role of 
interneuron plasticity during the development of receptive fields and in shaping sensory 
representations.
