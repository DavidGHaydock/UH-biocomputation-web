:summary: Maria Psarrou's journal club session where she introduces the NEURON simulator.

Biological computational modelling is a powerful tool to simulate a system and draw conclusions regarding its function. It also allows to make predictions for processes that still havenâ€™t been investigated in the laboratory. NEURON [1, 2] is an simulation environment, where empirical data are combined with analytic mathematical expressions, in order to model single neurons or neural networks. Neuronal cells are created as a series of connected sections, able to form realistic morphologies, and where different membrane properties (ionic, synaptic and passive) can be inserted. The interface and programming syntax are designed to offer an intuitive environment and emphasise on the biological functions in detail, rather than the the programming or numerical methods.
The purpose of this workshop is to give an introduction to the NEURON software and how it could be used, by building a simple neuronal cell model and testing its behaviour under different conditions.
