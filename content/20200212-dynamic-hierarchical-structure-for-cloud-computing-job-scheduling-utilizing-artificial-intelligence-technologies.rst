------------

Cloud computing is widely used due to its cost effectiveness and starvation 
free execution of processes. There has been substantial research done 
in job scheduling algorithm in cloud computing to improve scheduling 
performance, but little attention has been paid to structure design for 
job scheduling. This paper aims to improve job scheduling makespan (max 
processing time for given jobs) in a cloud environment. A dynamic 
hierarchical structure, which introduces sub-schedulers between scheduler 
and servers, is proposed to dynamically change the connection pattern 
between sub-schedulers and servers by using artificial intelligence search 
algorithms. Due to its dynamic and flexible nature, this design enables 
the system to adaptively accommodate the heterogeneity of jobs and resources 
in order to make most use of the resources available. Experimental results 
demonstrate that a dynamic hierarchical structure can significantly reduce 
the total makespan of the heterogeneous tasks allocated to heterogeneous 
resources, compared with a one-layer structure. This reduction is 
particularly pronounced when resources are scarce.
