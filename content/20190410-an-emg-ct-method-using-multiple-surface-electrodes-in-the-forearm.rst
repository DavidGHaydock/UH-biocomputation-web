------------

Electromyography computed tomography (EMG-CT) method is proposed for visualizing the individual muscle activities in the human forearm. An EMG conduction model was formulated for reverse-estimation of muscle activities using EMG signals obtained with multi surface electrodes. The optimization process was calculated using sequential quadratic programming by comparing the estimated EMG values from the model with the measured values. The individual muscle activities in the deep region were estimated and used to produce an EMG tomographic image.

Emil will reference the following papers:

"`An EMG-CT method using multiple surface electrodes in the forearm (Y. Nakajima et al, 2014)`_"

"`An Experimental Model on the Activity of Forearm Muscles Using Surface Electromyography (Y. Nakajima et al, 2009)`_"
