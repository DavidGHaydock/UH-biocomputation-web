:summary: Stella Holtorf's journal club session on the memory performance of plastic spiking neural networks.

Synaptic plasticity has a fundamental importance in the context of memory capacity of neural networks. Former studies suggest that inhibitory synaptic plasticity has a crucial regulatory role in neural networks, but its effects have been widely unexplored. In this study, we utilize the model of `Vogels et al. <http://www.sciencemag.org/content/334/6062/1569.short>`__ to investigate memory capacity in spiking neural networks. As Volker already presented last week, the model is  a spiking neural network, where spike-time dependent inhibitory synaptic plasticity at excitatory cells balances excitation and inhibition. Patterns are learned through one-shot Hebbian learning and we measured memory capacity by the signal-to-noise ratio during the recall phase. Building on the work of Alex Metaxas, we explored how adding spike-time dependent plasticity to connections other than the already plastic inhibitory to excitatory connections, affects memory capacity.
