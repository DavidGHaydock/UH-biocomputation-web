As an emerging solution to the handling of complex and evolving
software systems, Model Driven Engineering (MDE) is still very much in
evolution. The industrial demand is quite high while the research
answer for a sound set of foundation principles is still far from
being stabilized. Therefore it is important to provide a current state
of the art in MDE, describing what its origins are, what its present
state is, and where it seems to be presently leading. One important
question is how MDE relates to other contemporary technologies. This
tutorial proposes the ”technical space” concept to this purpose. The
two main objectives are to present first the basic MDE principles and
second how these principles may be mapped onto modern platform
support. Other issues that will be discussed are the applicability of
these ideas, concepts, and tools to solve current practical problems.
Various organizations and companies (OMG, IBM, Microsoft, etc.) are
currently proposing several environments claiming to support MDE.
Among these, the OMG MDATM(Model Driven Architecture) has a special
place since it was historically one of the original proposals in this
area. This work focuses on the identification of basic MDE principles,
practical characteristics of MDE (direct representation, automation,
and open standards), original MDE scenarios, and discussions of
suitable tools and methods.

The objectives of this talk are as follows:

- provide a general overview of Model Driven Engineering (MDE)
- cover some of the difficulties of this approach
