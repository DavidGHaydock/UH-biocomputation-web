**PhD in Computational & Cognitive Neuroscience**

An exciting full-time funded PhD opportunity has arisen at the University of Hertfordshire associated to a collaborative project with King’s College London and Brunel University London funded by the US Air Force. 

The project aims to build an explorative and predictive model of the brain that is sensitive to the transitions between sustained attention and mind-wandering states using an already collected simultaneously acquired EEG/fMRI dataset. Towards this goal, novel methods for characterizing, sequencing, and predicting neural dynamics at two complementary spatio-temporal resolution levels will be developed: level 1) electroencephalography (EEG) microstates, which are short quasi-stable topographies of brain electrical activity as measured at the scalp; and level 2) functional connectivity maps derived from the functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data.

We are seeking to appoint a graduate in Computer Science, Bioengineering, Physics, Mathematics, Neuroscience, or related fields, with an interest in cognitive neuroscience and neuroimaging, who has proven programming skills (e.g., Python, Matlab,  C++).  Knowledge of signal processing, time-series analysis, and machine learning would be an advantage. Previous experience of EEG and/or fMRI data analysis is highly desirable.

The 3-year full-time PhD studentship includes a stipend of £15,285 per annum in addition to covering tuition fees. Only EU and UK citizens are eligible to apply. 
The start date of the PhD will be January 2021. 

The PhD will be supervised by Dr Shabnam Kadir (University of Hertfordshire), Dr Elena Antonova (Brunel University London), Prof Robert Leech (Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King’s College London), and Prof Chrystopher Nehaniv (University of Hertfordshire, United Kingdom, and University of Waterloo, Ontario, Canada).

Interested candidates are encouraged to make informal inquiries with Dr Shabnam Kadir (:code:`s.kadir2 AT herts.ac.uk`) before making a formal application.

To apply, submit `an application form`_ (downloadable from https://www.herts.ac.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0010/31105/uh-application-form.pdf) together with a cover letter, CV, and scanned copies of  university transcripts and degree certificates (BSc, and if relevant MSc) via email to :code:`doctoralcollegeadmissions AT herts.ac.uk`, cc-ing Dr Shabnam on :code:`s.kadir2 AT herts.ac.uk` and Dr Antonova on :code:`elena.antonova AT brunel.ac.uk`
