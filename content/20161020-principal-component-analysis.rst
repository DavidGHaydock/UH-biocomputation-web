:summary: Rene te Boekhorst's journal club session on Principal component analysis (PCA).


Principle Component Analysis (PCA) is used by many but understood by few. 

In this talk I hope to explain some of the math behind the tool, to raise awareness for its potential (and pitfalls) and to discuss the relationship between PCA and cluster analysis.
In addition I will present some examples of its use in neuro-science, from my own work in robotics and an application in economics.
