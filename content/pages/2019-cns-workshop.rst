Workshop summary
----------------

The Computational Neuroscience community is a diverse, international, and
interdisciplinary community allowing for various successful career paths, each
with their own requirements. Students and postdocs in the community are
similarly presented with a diverse range of challenges, and excellent
mentorship from current leaders in the CNS community is an invaluable resource
for the development of future leaders in re- search or industry.

This workshop will provide CNS students and postdocs the opportunity to learn
about successful career paths and strategies from a panel of established
computational neuroscientists. Participants will hear from a range of
professionals, from junior faculty having recently transitioned from postdoc
status, researchers working outside of their home countries, to senior faculty
who are involved in reviewing journals, grants, and making academic hirings.
The panellists will discuss their current roles, their duties, their career
paths, and the skills necessary to navigate them. The workshop will focus on
providing suggestions, advice, tips, tricks, dos and don'ts on developing
these skills with the goal of preparing the attendees for their professional
journeys.  Postdocs and students are encouraged to ask questions to the
speakers and participate in the discussion of topics of universal interest or
specific concerns. To further foster communication in the group and address
more specific questions, attendees will be invited to go out for lunch together
with the organisers and panellists after the workshop.  The organisers are in
the process of preparing a dossier of information that will be disseminated to
the research community after the workshop. This will include information
gathered from a questionnaire sent to the panellists before the workshop, along
with salient points filtered from the discussion and Q&A sessions that will be
held at the workshop.
