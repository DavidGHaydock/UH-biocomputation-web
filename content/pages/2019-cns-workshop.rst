Pre-workshop questionnaire
--------------------------

The pre-workshop questionnaire is now live at https://forms.gle/V4yqh16HNV8DmwwE9

The questionnaire collects information on career paths, roles and
responsibilities, methods and tools that researchers use to get their work
done. The questionnaire should not take more than 15 minutes. Please consider
taking the questionnaire to share your experiences with the academic community.

From the list of CNS*2019 attendees that volunteer to be on the panel for the
workshop, the organisers will choose 6--8 diverse profiles to be able to cover
the broadest range of topics.

Workshop summary
----------------

The Computational Neuroscience community is a diverse, international, and
interdisciplinary community allowing for various successful career paths, each
with their own requirements. Students and postdocs in the community are
similarly presented with a diverse range of challenges, and excellent
mentorship from current leaders in the CNS community is an invaluable resource
for the development of future leaders in re- search or industry.

This workshop will provide CNS students and postdocs the opportunity to learn
about successful career paths and strategies from a panel of established
computational neuroscientists. Participants will hear from a range of
professionals, from junior faculty having recently transitioned from postdoc
status, researchers working outside of their home countries, to senior faculty
who are involved in reviewing journals, grants, and making academic hirings.
The panellists will discuss their current roles, their duties, their career
paths, and the skills necessary to navigate them. The workshop will focus on
providing suggestions, advice, tips, tricks, dos and don'ts on developing
these skills with the goal of preparing the attendees for their professional
journeys.  Postdocs and students are encouraged to ask questions to the
speakers and participate in the discussion of topics of universal interest or
specific concerns. To further foster communication in the group and address
more specific questions, attendees will be invited to go out for lunch together
with the organisers and panellists after the workshop.  The organisers are in
the process of preparing a dossier of information that will be disseminated to
the research community after the workshop. This will include information
gathered from a questionnaire sent to attendees (and the academic community in
general) before the workshop, along with salient points filtered from the
discussion and Q&A sessions that will be held at the workshop.
