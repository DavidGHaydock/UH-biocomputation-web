:slug: 09-CNS18-workshop

Workshop at `CNS 2018 <http://www.cnsorg.org/cns-2018>`__
----------------------------------------------------------

**Organisers:**

- `Dieter Jaeger, Emory University, USA`_ :code:`(djaeger AT emory DOT edu)`
- `Volker Steuber, University of Hertfordshire, UK`_ :code:`(v DOT steuber AT herts DOT ac DOT uk)`

**Wednesday, July 18, 9 a.m. - 6 p.m.**

-------------------

Most abstract neural network models operate with single compartment neurons,
i.e. without dendrites.  In contrast, just about all mammalian neurons receive
a majority of their synaptic inputs on dendrites.  It is becoming increasingly
clear that this is not just to provide more surface area and sample inputs in
specific spatial configurations, but that dendrites supply neurons with
important non-linear functions.Â  This workshop will highlight modelling studies
that explore the properties of dendritic computations through compartmental
modelling.  The distinct dendritic computational properties of different cell
types will be highlighted.
