The Biocomputation Research Group forms part of the Centre for Computer Science and Informatics Research (CCSIR), which is based within the Science and Technology Research Institute (STRI). Research in the Biocomputation Research Group involves the development of computational models to study biological systems, and the application of biologically-inspired machine learning algorithms for the analysis of real-world data. Members of the Biocomputation Group analyse and simulate computational models at different levels of complexity, and collaborate closely with leading experimentalists in the UK and abroad.

Research in the Biocomputation Group concentrates on the following areas:

- Computational Neuroscience (led by `Dr. Volker Steuber`_).
- Quantitative Modelling in Systems Biology (led by `Dr. Maria Schilstra`_).
- Neural Networks and Machine Learning (led by `Dr. Neil Davey`_).
- Bioinformatics (led by Dr. Rene te Boekhorst).
- Development of Neural Controllers for Agents (led by Professor Rod Adams).
- Algebraic Biology (led by Professor Chrystopher Nehaniv).

Software developed by the group is made available at our `Github repository`_.
Please do check the `news pages <blog_index.html>`_ for open positions and other updates from the group.
