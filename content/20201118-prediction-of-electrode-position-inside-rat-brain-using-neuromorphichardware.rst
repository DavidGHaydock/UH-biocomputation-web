This week on Journal Club session Shavika Rastogi will talk about her master thesis entitled "Prediction of Electrode Position inside rat brain using Neuromorphic Hardware".

------------

Neural probes with large number of close packed recording sites each comprising
of 32electrodes are being developed for large scale neuronal recordings from
multiple brain areassimultaneously to understand complex brain activity in vivo.
By precisely mapping the positionof each site inside rat brain, they help us to
characterize neural activity on the basis of corticaldepth from where it is
obtained. Their application lies in neurosurgery, where it is important tolocate
the target of surgical interest inside the brain in real time. In this work, we
have firstcompared various methods from literature to analyze extracellular
activity recorded using CMOSneural probes from different cortical depths and
from different locations along same lateral axisof rat brain to find a criterion
on the basis of which recordings can be classified. After findingout the most
promising criterion, we have tried to implement it on neuromorphic hardware
SpiNNaker. We tested single neuron and spiking excitatory-inhibitory network
forimplementation and found that excitatory-inhibitory network is more robust to
noise present insignal and its output can be improved by introducing lateral
inhibition. Our results show thatSpiNNaker can be used for rough indication of
cortical depth.
