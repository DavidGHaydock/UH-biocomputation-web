:summary: Reinoud Maex's journal club session on a metric for consciousness, and the decline of the Hodgkin-Huxley theory.

Having to wait a lot in railway stations, I will present two recent articles from Scientific American.

The first one (November 2017, written by Christof Koch) discusses a study by Casarotto et al. (Annals of Neurology 80, 718-729) where a metric of algorithmic complexity of an evoked EEG response is used to measure consciousness in coma patients and controls.

The second one (April 2018) discusses old work by Ichiji Tasaki (1960-1990s) and recent work by Thomas Heimburg claiming that action potential propagation is not an electrical but a mechanical phenomenon (a shock wave with piezo-electric side-effects).
