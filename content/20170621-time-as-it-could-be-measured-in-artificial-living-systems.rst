:summary: Andrei Robus' journal club session on Time as it could be measured in artificial living systems.

Being able to measure time, whether directly or indirectly, is a significant
advantage for an organism. It permits it to predict regular events, and prepare
for them on time. Thus, clocks are ubiquitous in biology. In the presented paper,
we consider the most minimal abstract pure clocks and investigate their
characteristics with respect to their ability to measure time. Amongst others
we find fundamentally diametral clock characteristics, such as oscillatory
behaviour for local time measurement or decay-based clocks measuring time
periods in scales global to the problem. We also include cascades of
independent clocks ("clock bags") and composite clocks with controlled
dependency; the latter show various regimes of markedly different dynamics.
