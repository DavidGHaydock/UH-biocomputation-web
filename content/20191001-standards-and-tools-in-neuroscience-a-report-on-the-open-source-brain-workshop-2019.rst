:summary: Ankur Sinha's journal club session where he reports on the
          information presented and discussions held at the `Open Source Brain
          Workshop`_ in September, 2019.


While scientific work and output was traditionally limited to relatively small
expert communities, the landscape is rapidly changing. Modern Science is far
too complex to be carried out in isolation, and the need to increase the uptake
of scientific output in society now seems far more pressing. As a result,
scientific communities are pushing to make Science more `Open
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_science>`__.

The Neuroscience research community has also made this commitment. The
philosophy of `Free/Open
<https://www.fsf.org/blogs/community/user-liberation-watch-and-share-our-new-video/>`__
Science, however, must be backed by `Free/Open standards and tools
<http://opensourceforneuroscience.org/>`__.  The `Open Source Brain`_ project
is one of many initiatives that focus on developing Free/Open tools and
standards for Neuroscience. A recent `publication
<https://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(19)30444-1>`__ summarises
their work.

While initially targeting computational Neuroscience, following the renewal of
their funding from the Wellcome Trust, the `Open Source Brain`_ project are
expanding their deliverables to support experimental data as well.
With this in mind, they organised a `workshop
<https://www.fsf.org/blogs/community/user-liberation-watch-and-share-our-new-video/>`__
in September to discuss two key themes:

- Accessible sharing of cellular Neuroscience data: by supporting the
  `Neurodata Without Borders (NWB) <https://www.nwb.org/>`__ format.
- Modelling the cortex across scales: by further expanding the `NeuroML
  <https://www.neuroml.org/>`__ model description language.


Since I was fortunate enough to attend this workshop, in this talk, I will
summarise the main points that were discussed here. Time permitting, I will
hope to begin a discussion in our group on how we can ensure that we follow and
contribute to these standards and tools to make our research work and
its outputs "default to Free/Open".

I will conclude with a (another?) short marketing pitch for our `NeuroFedora
<https://neuro.fedoraproject.org>`__ project which shares these goals.
