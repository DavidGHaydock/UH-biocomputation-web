The session will be in E374 at 15:00. Please
attend the session if you'd like to learn a bit about the SpiNNaker
boards.

What are SpinNNaker boards?
---------------------------

SpiNNaker is a novel computer architecture inspired by the working of
the human brain.

A SpiNNaker machine is a massively parallel computing platform,
targeted towards three main areas of research:

Neuroscience: Understanding how the brain works is a Grand Challenge of
21st century science. We will provide the platform to help
neuroscientists to unravel the mystery that is the mind.  The largest
SpiNNaker machine will be capable of simulating a billion simple
neurons, or millions of neurons with complex structure and internal
dynamics.

Robotics:  SpiNNaker is a good target for researchers in robotics, who
need mobile, low power computation. A small SpiNNaker board makes it
possible to simulate a network of tens of thousands of spiking neurons,
process sensory input and generate motor output, all in real time and
in a low power system.

Computer Science: SpiNNaker breaks the rules followed by traditional
supercomputers that rely on deterministic, repeatable communications
and reliable computation. SpiNNaker nodes communicate using simple
messages (spikes) that are inherently unreliable. This break with
determinism offers new challenges, but also the potential to discover
powerful new principles of massively parallel computation.
