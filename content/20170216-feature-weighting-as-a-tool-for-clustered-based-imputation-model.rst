:summary: Deepak Panday's journal club session where he discusses feature weighting.

Imputation of missing attribute-values is an important data pre-processing
step. Missing of the attribute values are an inevitable problem in real-world
data collection. However, most of the data processing models donâ€™t have any
mechanism to deal with missing values. One of the solutions to this problem is
to have an imputation step added in data pre-processing. Imputation model
relays on the initial prediction of the missing values and has no mechanism to
distinguish the observed and imputed values. But, the imputed values are only
as good as the assumption used to create them. In this research, we introduce
an unsupervised cluster-dependent feature weighing imputation model. This model
uses the feature weighing factor to rescaled the data to nullify the effect of
initial prediction of the missing attribute-values.
