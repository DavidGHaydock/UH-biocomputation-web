:summary: Edward Wakelam's journal club session on corporate business strategy.

All successful organisations ensure that their corporate IT strategy is fully and continuously aligned with their business strategy from vision and mission statements, through corporate objectives, business planning and management accounting to individual staff objectives.  Day to day synchronisation of all of these components across all organisational departments, for example Finance, Sales, Delivery, Customer Support, Human Resources and Marketing, is a key objective of corporate IT implementations.  Exploiting the latest technological developments challenges the IT function, however, change (under control) is a positive driver for businesses, usually generating their most profitable business.  I will discuss the component parts of organisations and how they work together and how cognisance and understanding of this is career beneficial, how change is the norm and what personal strategies are key to success.
