:summary: Damien Drix's journal club session on learning sparse codes and
          predictive context with compartmentalised inputs.

There has been renewed interest in dendrites in computational neuroscience. The
corresponding concept in artificial neural networks is that of
compartmentalised inputs: integrating different pathways in distinct locations
within each unit, with potentially different learning rules. Here we show how a
single layer of neurons with multiple compartments can learn sparse codes and
their predictive context using a local unsupervised rule, and how this could be
used as a building block for cognitive architectures.
