This week on Journal Club session Emil Dmitruk talk about the paper "Hyperbolic geometry of the olfactory space".


------------

In the natural environment, the sense of smell, or olfaction, serves to detect 
toxins and judge nutritional content by taking advantage of the associations
between compoundsas they are created in biochemical reactions. This suggests 
that the nervous system can classify odors based on statistics of their 
co-occurrence within natural mixtures rather than from the chemical structures 
of the ligands themselves. We show that this statistical perspective makes 
it possible to map odors to points in a hyperbolic space. Hyperbolic coordinates 
have a long but often underappreciated history of relevance to biology. For 
example, these coordinates approximate the distance between species computed 
along dendrograms and, more generally, between points within hierarchical 
treeâ€“like networks. We find that both natural odors and human perceptual 
descriptions of smells can be described using a three-dimensional hyperbolic 
space. This match in geometries can avoid distortions that would otherwise 
arise when mapping odors to perception.
