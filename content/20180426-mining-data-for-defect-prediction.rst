:summary: Jean Petric's journal club session on Mining data for defect prediction.

Defect prediction relies on data and modelling techniques. Previous work has predominantly been focused to improving the latter. Despite numerous studies exploiting a wide range of machine learning techniques, prediction accuracies improve at a slow pace. On the other hand, the focus on data has somewhat been limited. High-quality data is difficult to obtain and mostly consists of metrics which have been lingering round for a long time. Due to the influx of digital data, other fields have developed some interesting techniques for its analysis. In this journal club I will discuss some of those techniques for data analysis and link them to their possible use in defect prediction.
