:summary: Marco Craveiro's journal club session on using watertight polygon meshes for neuronal morphology representation. 

I will report on the progress of my work to use polygon meshes as
a way to represent neuronal morphologies. The presentation is
composed of two parts. The first part discusses the acquisition
of neuronal morphology data from microscopy and the generation of
computer representations using the SWC format. It is intended to
provide a background on the second part of the presentation,
which focuses on using watertight polygon meshes as a way to
represent neuronal morphology. We shall cover the advantages of
this approach and the difficulties faced. In this context shall
discuss the paper by McDougal et al. [1]
