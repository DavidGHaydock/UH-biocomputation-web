:summary: Ankur Sinha's journal club session on the NeuroFedora_ initiative.

In this seminar, I introduce the NeuroFedora_ initiative to the group. I
explain our goals, our philosophy, our methods, our current state and, solicit
feedback on our work.

---------

The (current) goal of the `NeuroFedora SIG`_ is to provide a ready to use
platform for neuroscientists.  We aim to do this by making commonly used
Neuroscience software easily installable on a Fedora_ Linux system.

Neuroscience is an extremely multidisciplinary field. It brings together
mathematicians, chemists, biologists, physicists, psychologists, engineers
(electrical and others), computer scientists, and more. A lot of software is
used nowadays in Neuroscience for:

- data collection, analysis, and sharing.
- image processing (a lot of ML is used here, think Data Science).
- simulation of brain networks (NEURON_, Nest_, Moose_, PyNN_, Brian_).
- dissemination of scientific results (peer reviewed and otherwise, think
  LaTeX_).

Given that a large proportion of neuroscientists are not trained in computer
science, a lot of resources are spent setting up systems, installing software
(often building whole `dependency chains
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_hell>`__ from source). This can be
especially hard for people not well-versed in software development and related
fields.

So, at NeuroFedora_, we aim to enable Neuroscience research by providing a
ready to use Fedora_ based system for researchers to work with. NeuroFedora_ is
`Free software <https://www.fsf.org/about/what-is-free-software>`__ and is
therefore free to all to use, modify, study, and share.
