:summary: Neil Davey's journal club session on Network Connectivity.

Neil will talk about graphs (aka networks) and how their structure relates to their function and functionality.  
In particular he will discuss the relation between connectivity and how function plays out in some neuronal networks.
No discussion of graphs would be complete without some reference to Small World networks, the Kevin Bacon game and scale free networks, together with a netlogo simulation.
