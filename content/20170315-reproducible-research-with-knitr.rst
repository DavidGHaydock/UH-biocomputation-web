:summary: Jean Petrić's journal club session on Knitr_.



In this session, I will discuss dynamic report generation using Knitr_ (Sweave). Knitr_ is an R package that enables R code integration into various markup languages such as LaTeX, HTML, Markdown etc. It can be used for writing research papers, theses, or even producing web-pages for presenting results. Knitr_ is valuable in scientific circles for several reasons. Beside allowing reports to be flexible and modified automatically, Knitr_ makes reproducible research simpler than manual approaches. When used properly, Knitr_ describes the steps of an experiment explicitly, and these steps are self-documented (by using R code). Knitr_ itself is not complicated, however it does require some knowledge of the R language.

This session will be divided in two parts. In first part I will give a brief background to Knitr_. I will use second part of the talk to demonstrate several examples on how to use Knitr_ to make a (dynamic) research paper.
