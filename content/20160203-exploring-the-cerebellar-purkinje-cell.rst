:summary: Kirsty Kidd's journal club session where she summarises her work in investigating changes in the morphology of cerebellar Purkinje cells over different species and the effects of these changes on the cells' ability to process and transfer information.

Purkinje cells are a constant feature of the cerebellar cortex. Though often characterised by their complex dendritic branching, phylogenetically earlier Purkinje cells are much simpler structures. With studies of in vitro electrophysiological behaviour suggesting that firing patterns are very similar across species [1, 2, 3], what has informed such an expensive change in morphology and what effect has this change had on the cells ability to process and transfer information?

This talk will summarise my work in investigating these questions by modelling and analysing Purkinje cells from seven different species.
