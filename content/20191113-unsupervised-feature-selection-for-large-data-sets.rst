------------

The last decade saw a considerable increase in the availability 
of data. Unfortunately, this increase was overshadowed by various 
technical difficulties that arise when analysing large data sets. 
These include long processing times, large requirements for data 
storage, and other technical issues related to the analysis of 
high-dimensional data sets. By consequence, reducing the cardinality 
of data sets (with minimum information loss) has become of interest 
to virtually any data scientist. Many feature selection algorithms 
have been introduced in the literature, however, there are two main 
issues with these. First, the vast majority of such algorithms 
require labelled samples to learn from. One should note it is often 
too expensive to label a meaningful amount of data, particularly 
when dealing with large data sets. Second, these algorithms were 
not designed to deal with the volume of data we have nowadays. 
This paper introduces a novel unsupervised feature selection 
algorithm designed specifically to deal with large data sets. 
Our experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method.
