:summary: Marco Craveiro's journal club session on "Handling Variability in Model Transformations and Generators" by Voelter et al. and "A Feature Model for Model-to-Text Transformation Languages" by Rose et al.

The talk will be based mainly on Voelter et al's paper on "Handling
Variability in Model Transformations and Generators". Marco will provide
an introduction to the topic and explain how it relates to his
research. At the end of the talk he will provide a brief introduction
to Rose et al's paper on "A Feature Model for Model-to-Text
Transformation Languages" and explain how it interlinks with the first
paper and his research.

Main paper by Voelter et al: Handling Variability in Model Transformations and Generators

Software product line engineering aims to reduce development
time, effort, cost, and complexity by taking advantage of the
commonality within a portfolio of similar products. The effectiveness
of a software product line approach directly depends on how well
feature variability within the portfolio is implemented and managed
throughout the development lifecycle, from early analysis through
maintenance and evolution. Using DSLs and AO to implement product
lines can yield significant advantages, since the variability can be
implemented on a higher level of abstraction, in less detailed models.
This paper illustrates how variability can be implemented in
model-to-model transformations and code generators using
aspect-oriented techniques. These techniques are important ingredients
for the aspectoriented model-driven product line engineering approach
presented in [13].

Secondary paper by Rose et al: A Feature Model for Model-to-Text Transformation Languages

Model-to-text (M2T) transformation is an important model management
operation, as it is used to implement code and documentation
generation; model serialisation (enabling model interchange); and
model visualisation and exploration. Despite the creation of the MOF
Model-To-Text Transformation Language (MOFM2T) in 2008, many very
different M2T languages exist today. Because there is little
interoperability between M2T languages and rewriting an existing M2T
transformation in a new language is costly, developers face a
difficult choice when selecting a M2T language. In this paper, we use
domain analysis to identify a preliminary feature model for M2T
languages. We demonstrate the appropriateness of the feature model by
describing two different M2T languages, and discuss potential
applications for a tool-supported and model-driven approach to
describing the features of M2T languages.
