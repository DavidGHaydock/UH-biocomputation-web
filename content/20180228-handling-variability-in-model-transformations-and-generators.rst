:summary: Marco Craveiro's journal club session on "Handling Variability in Model Transformations and Generators" by Völter et al.

The talk will be on Völter et al's paper on "Handling
Variability in Model Transformations and Generators". Marco will provide
an introduction to the topic and explain how it relates to his
research.

Paper abstract:

Software product line engineering aims to reduce development
time, effort, cost, and complexity by taking advantage of the
commonality within a portfolio of similar products. The effectiveness
of a software product line approach directly depends on how well
feature variability within the portfolio is implemented and managed
throughout the development lifecycle, from early analysis through
maintenance and evolution. Using DSLs and AO to implement product
lines can yield significant advantages, since the variability can be
implemented on a higher level of abstraction, in less detailed models.
This paper illustrates how variability can be implemented in
model-to-model transformations and code generators using
aspect-oriented techniques. These techniques are important ingredients
for the aspectoriented model-driven product line engineering approach
presented in [13].
