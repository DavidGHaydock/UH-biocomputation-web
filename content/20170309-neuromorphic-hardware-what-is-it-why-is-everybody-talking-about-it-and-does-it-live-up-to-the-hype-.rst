:summary: Michael Schmuker's journal club session where he discusses neuromorphic hardware

During the last decade, a variety of platforms for neuromorphic computing, so-called neuromorphic hardware systems, have been introduced by different players in academia and industry. They are often praised as promising systems for future computing, especially now that conventional processors don’t get faster anymore. But what is this “neuromorphic hardware” after all, and what are the promises it holds? In my presentation I will give an overview on the neuromorphic technologies that we can access through the Human Brain Project. I will also present results from a recent study where we compared the performance of neuromorphic systems to conventional technologies. This study sheds light on constraints of neuromorphic systems, and opportunities to overcome them. Finally, I will provide an outlook on how neuromorphic sensory computation might look like in the future.
