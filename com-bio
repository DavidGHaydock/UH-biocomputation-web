Hello,

Yi Sun will present at the journal club this 1600 Friday 15 December 2017 in LB252.

Title and abstract of the talk is below:
Feature Selection Modelling for Percutaneous Absorption across Synthetic Membranes

----------------------------------------
Yi will be discussing feature selection modelling for percutaneous absorption across Synthetic membranes

Abstract is below:

-------

Predicting the rate of percutaneous absorption across mammalian and artificial membranes is a complex problem.
Different machine learning models have been used in previous studies, and results show that Gaussian processes  provided the best result, based on a range of statistical measures.
In the current study, a dataset of synthetic (Polydimethylsiloxane, PDMS) membranes, containing so many descriptors, is considered.
One of the main purposes of the study is to use feature selection methods to select a set of molecular properties that exert the most important influence on percutaneous absorption across PDMS membranes, in the hope that this will better inform studies on human skin.
